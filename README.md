# ENAS-Keras
Implementation of Efficient Neural Architecture Search with Keras


## Block.py
outputs a combination of 2 layers respectively fed with 2 inputs

## Cell.py
outputs a stack of Blocks (from Block.py)

## Controller.py
generates the RNN controller for ENAS

## test.py
what I am currently testing/implementing
