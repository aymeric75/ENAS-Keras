- add the Embedding Layer AFTER the Lambda/Sampling layer (test on test.py)			DONE

- reformate the Controller Class to the new version (change in Controller.py)		DONE

	- remove the last Embedding layer of the controller (we just need the Sample layer for the last choice)

- Training Loop (coding it in Controller.py main() function)

	- at every batch/feedforward

			- retrieve output of each softmax + Sample								DONE

			- compute gradient of the proba .. NearlyDONE..
